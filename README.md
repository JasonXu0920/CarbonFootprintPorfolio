Carbon Intensity (CI) is a popular metric for assessing the carbon footprint of a company. It is calculated as the ratio of carbon emitted by the company (over a given fiscal year, in tons of CO2), to the revenue of the company (over the same period in $million USD). The carbon emitted by a company is typically calculated by summing the carbon emitted directly as a result of their business operations (Scope 1), and the carbon emitted when generating energy, such as electricity, that is consumed by the company (Scope 2).
Investors are often interested in the aggregate carbon footprint for a portfolio of companies that they are invested in. The weighted average Carbon Intensity (WACI) of all the companies in the portfolio can be used for this purpose. The weights that are used in this calculation represent the proportional dollar value of each investment in the portfolio on a given date. 
WACI can also be calculated for a benchmark portfolio (such as the ASX 20, which tracks the performance of the largest 20 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange). In this case the weights reflect the proportional total market value of each company in the benchmark on a given date.
